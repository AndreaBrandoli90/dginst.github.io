                A timestamp proves that some data existed prior to some point in time.
                The <a href="www.opentimestamps.org">OpenTimestamps</a> protocol defines
                an open standard consisting in a set of operations for creating provable
                blockchain timestamps and later independently verifying them.
            </p>

                An OpenTimestamps <em>calendar</em> server provides aggregation of multiple
                documents allowing to timestamp all of them at the same time using just a
                single blockchain transaction.
                Moreover, a calendar server can offer its services to multiple remote
                OpenTimestamps clients.
                While anyone could realize a timestamp with the permissionless
                blockchain(s) by paying the transaction fees, OpenTimestamps public servers
                are free to use without any registration or API key.

                While the OpenTimestamps protocol is blockchain agnostic,
                a timestamp is as reliable as the used blockchain:
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                        very reliable when using Bitcoin
                        because that blockchain is secured by huge
                        computational power (<em>proof-of-work</em>);
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                        much less reliable with other public permissionless blockchain;
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                        when used with private permissioned blockchain its reliability
                        depends on the reliability of the chain governance: in that case
                        traditional certification authorities are probably better.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                This webpage is an interface to create timestamp proofs using the
                facilities provided by the OpenTimestamps public free bitcoin calendar
                servers: Bitcoin's blockchain is used as a timestamp notary, i.e. the proof
                is attested in a Bitcoin block header.
                Timestamps can be verified independently using a local
                <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/"">Bitcoin Core</a>
                node; anyway, since a web-page cannot access the local filesystem,
                this page relies on public block-explorers for verification.

                It should be obvious, but it is worth mentioning that timestamping
                (using the OpenTimestamps protocol or any alternative approach):
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                    does not prove authorship (that should be proved using a
                    digital signature);
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                    does not ensure veracity of the timestamped document.
                    </li>
                </ul>
